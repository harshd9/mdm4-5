git init

Output:

Now check the user information using
git config â€“global

As there are no users defined, let us define it using following two commands

git config --global user.name "bhushan"
git config --global user.email "bhushan,jadhav1@gmail.com"

Now, check the list of users

git config --global --list
Output:
user.name=bhushan
user.email=bhushan.jadhav1@gmail.com

2. Create and Commit Initial Files
Create a new file and make an initial commit.
# Create a new file
echo "This is the first version of my project." > project.txt

# Add the file to the staging area
git add project.txt

# Commit the file to the repository
git commit -m "Initial commit with project.txt"

Output:
[main (root-commit) 1234567] Initial commit with project.txt
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 project.txt

3. Make Changes and Commit Again
Edit the file and make another commit to track the changes.
# Append a new line to the file
echo "Adding more content to the project." >> project.txt

# Add the file to the staging area
git add project.txt

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Added more content to project.txt"

Output:
[main 89abcdef] Added more content to project.txt
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)


4. View Commit History
Check the commit history to see the changes over time.
# View the commit history
git log

    Initial commit with project.txt

5. Revert to a Previous Version
Suppose you want to revert to the initial version of project.txt. You can do this using the commit hash from the history.
# Reset the file to the state of the initial commit
git checkout 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567 -- project.txt

This command will replace project.txt with its version from the specified commit. The file is now in the state it was when the initial commit was made.
6. Commit the Reverted Changes
If you want to make this reversion a new commit, you need to add and commit the changes.
# Stage the reverted file
git add project.txt

# Commit the reverted file
git commit -m "Reverted project.txt to initial version"

Output:
[main fedcba98] Reverted project.txt to initial version
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
